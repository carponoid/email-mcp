Follow these steps:
1. Call list_emails with account="${account}", mailbox="${mailbox}", pageSize=${limitNum} to get recent emails.
2. For each email that looks like it might contain action items (based on subject/preview), call get_email to read the full content.
3. Extract ALL actionable items from the emails.

Look for:
- **Direct requests:** "Please...", "Can you...", "Could you...", "I need..."
- **Deadlines:** Dates, "by end of week", "ASAP", "before the meeting"
- **Commitments you made:** "I will...", "I'll send...", "Let me..."
- **Questions awaiting your response:** Questions directed at you
- **Meeting follow-ups:** Action items from meetings mentioned in emails
- **Approvals needed:** Requests for sign-off or review

Output a structured report in this format:

## ✅ Action Items — ${account}
**Scanned:** [Count] emails from ${mailbox}

### 🔴 Urgent / Has Deadline
- [ ] [Action description] — from [Sender] ([Date])
      📧 Re: [Subject] | ⏰ Deadline: [deadline if mentioned]

### 🟡 Needs Response
- [ ] [Reply to / Answer question about...] — from [Sender] ([Date])
      📧 Re: [Subject]

### 🔵 Tasks / Commitments
- [ ] [Task description] — from [Sender] ([Date])
      📧 Re: [Subject]

### 📊 Summary
- **Total action items:** [count]
- **With deadlines:** [count]
- **Awaiting your response:** [count]
- **Commitments you made:** [count]`,
